**CHALLENGE:** 

You have a basic understanding of arrays, state, views, images, text, and more, so let’s put them together: your challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.

So, very roughly:

1. _Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors._
1. _Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose._
1. _The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game._
1. _If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point._
1. _The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown._
1. _So, if the app chose “Rock” and “Win” the player would need to choose “Paper”, but if the app chose “Rock” and “Lose” the player would need to choose “Scissors”._
